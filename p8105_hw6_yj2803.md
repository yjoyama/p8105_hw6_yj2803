    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age), # change victim_age from char to numeric

Logistic regression for crime outcome and victim age, sex and race in
Baltimore, MD.

``` r

  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") |> 
  glm(homicide ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, family = binomial, data = _) |>

    or = exp(estimate), # calculate odds ratio of the coefficients
    lb.or = exp(estimate - qnorm(.975) * std.error), # obtain the lower level of 95% CI

```

|   or | lb.or | ub.or |
|-----:|------:|------:|
| 2.35 |  1.79 |  3.08 |

In Baltimore, MD, male victims have approximately 2.35 times the odds
(95% CI: 1.79 - 3.08) of resolved cases than the unresolved cases
compared to female victims when all other variables fixed.

Now run the logistic regression for each of the cities.

``` r
# set up a function to get odds ratio for coef and 95% CI from logistic regression output
or_ci_glm = function(df){
  df |> 
    filter(term == "victim_sexMale") |> 
    mutate(
      or = exp(estimate),
      lb.or = exp(estimate - qnorm(.975) * std.error),
      ub.or = exp(estimate + qnorm(.975) * std.error)
    ) |> 
    select(or, lb.or, ub.or) 
}


case_log = df_homicide |>
  nest(df = -city_state) |> 
  mutate(
    log_model = purrr::map(df, \(df) glm(homicide ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, family = binomial, data = df)), # save logistic models for each city as list
    results = map(log_model, broom::tidy) # save logistic model results in tibble as list
  ) |>
  mutate(
    ors = map(results, or_ci_glm) # save odds ratios and 95%CI as list
  ) |> 
  unnest(ors) |> 
  select(city_state, or, lb.or, ub.or) 
  
# visualize the results
case_log |> 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, or)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = or)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(x = city_state, ymin = lb.or, ymax = ub.or)) +
  labs(
    title = "The odds ratios of resolved cases among male compared to female",
    x = "City",
    y = "Odds ratio"
  ) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) 
```

From the plot, we can see that in Albuquerque, NM, the odds of cases to
be solved is the lowest in male compared to female holding other
variables (OR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.27 - 1.2). In New York, NY, the odds of
resolved cases in male compared to female was the highest keeping all
other variables fixed (OR: 3.81, 95% CI: 2 - 7.25).

The estimate of $r^2$ and $log(\hat{\beta}_1*\hat{\beta}_2)$ show
left-skewed unimodal distribution. This indicates that there may be
variability in the data.  
\* 3361 out of 5000 $log(\hat{\beta}_1*\hat{\beta}_2)$ values were
removed from the plot because the log of a negative number could not be
calculated.

The 95% confidence interval for $r^2$ is 0.89 - 0.94;
$log(\hat{\beta}_1*\hat{\beta}_2)$ is -8.98 - -4.6
